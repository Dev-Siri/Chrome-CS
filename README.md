# Chrome++

Chrome++ (more like Chrome--) is an **extremely** limited browser written in C# and WinForms. <br />
It basically just uses a webview to show the webpage and a input to take in an url.

That's it. Pretty boring right?

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Siri/Chrome-CS.git
```

- Build the app
```sh
dotnet build
```

That's it! <br />
You can also skip the build step and download the app's executable CIL from releases.
